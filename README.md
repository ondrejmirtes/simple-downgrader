Simple Downgrader
---------------------------

This tool is aimed at providing [`phpstan/phpstan-src`](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-src) with a way to develop with modern PHP 8.2+ features, but downgrade the source code during distribution build to support PHP 7.2+.

No support is provided outside of bugs impacting development and usage of [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/).
